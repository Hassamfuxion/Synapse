/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles. Only the authenticated user can read, create, update, or delete their own profile data.
 * @dataStructure User profiles are stored under the `/users/{userId}/profile` path, where `{userId}` must match the Firebase Auth UID.
 * @keySecurityDecisions - User profiles are strictly private and not listable by other users or admins.
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization  The rules rely on the `userId` path segment matching the `request.auth.uid` to enforce ownership. There is no need for denormalization.
 * @structuralSegregation The UserProfile is stored in user's subcollection to allow path-based access control.
